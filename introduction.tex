\section{Introduction}
Micro-controllers are a device that allow your code to deal with things in the real world. In this workshop we will use an Arduino Micro-controller, an easy to use device that simplifies this process for us. You may have seen them before and they are used in ENGG1100 and some ENGG1200 projects.\\
